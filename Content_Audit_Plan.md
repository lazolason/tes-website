# Content & Visual Audit Plan for Mexel Energy Sustain (TES Website)

**Audit Date:** December 2024  
**Scope:** Home, Solutions, Industries, Knowledge Hub, About  
**Objective:** Achieve 10/10 visual authority for a B2B engineering firm in the industrial cooling sector

---

## Executive Summary

The TES website has a **solid structural foundation** but relies heavily on **generic stock imagery** that undermines its technical authority. Key gaps include:

1. **Industries Landing Page** – Uses only SVG icons; no contextual photography
2. **Homepage "IndustryGrid"** – Also icons only; misses opportunity for visual storytelling
3. **Hero Imagery** – Effective before/after slider exists but lacks context photography for other sections
4. **Knowledge Hub** – Almost entirely text-based; no visual evidence of methodology or case study outcomes
5. **About Page** – Limited team/facility photography

## Phase 1: Current Asset Inventory

### ✅ Assets That Work Well (Keep/Optimize)

| Asset | Location | Assessment |
|-------|----------|------------|
| `before-fouled-tubes.png` / `after-stabilised-tubes.png` | Hero slider | **Strong** – Shows tangible before/after results |
| `condenser.png` | Power-Energy page | **Good** – Relevant industrial equipment |
| `cooling-tower.png` | Public assets | **Good** – Industrial context |
| `dosing-skid.png` | Products page | **Strong** – Shows actual TES equipment |
| `lazola-sonqishe.png` | About page | **Good** – Humanizes the brand |
| `logo.png` | Global | **Good** – Clear branding |

### ⚠️ Assets Requiring Optimization

| Asset | Issue | Recommendation |
|-------|-------|----------------|
| `industry-power.png` (5MB) | Generic power plant | Replace with actual Eskom site or similar |
| `industry-mining.png` (5MB) | Generic mining stock | Replace with SA mining context |
| `industry-refinery.png` (5MB) | Generic refinery | More relevant petrochemical imagery |
| `industry-data-centre.png` (5MB) | Generic server room | Needs cooling system focus |
| `industry-agriculture.png` (5MB) | Generic farm | Show irrigation/cooling systems |
| `industry-ports.png` (5.6MB) | Generic port | Show marine cooling infrastructure |
| `food-beverage.png` (6.4MB) | Generic factory | Show brewery/processing cooling |

### ❌ Critical Gaps

| Page/Section | Current State | Visual Authority Impact |
|--------------|---------------|------------------------|
| **Industries Landing** (`/industries`) | SVG icons only | **-40%** – Feels like a sitemap, not a showcase |
| **IndustryGrid Component** (Homepage) | SVG icons only | **-30%** – Misses conversion opportunity |
| **Knowledge Hub** (`/knowledge-hub`) | Text + icons only | **-50%** – No visual proof of methodology |
| **Case Studies** | Minimal imagery | **-60%** – Stories without evidence |
| **Products Page** | Some imagery | **-20%** – Needs process/application shots |

### 3.3 Stock Photography Guidelines (When Custom Not Available)

**DO Use:**
- Industrial photography from reputable sources (Getty Industrial, Alamy)
- South African context when possible (recognizable landscapes, infrastructure)
- Images showing actual equipment, not abstract concepts
- Warm, professional color grading consistent with brand

**DON'T Use:**
- Generic "happy workers" stock photos
- Overly polished American/European facilities when targeting SA market
- Abstract technology graphics (circuits, glowing orbs) for industrial content
- Watermarked or low-resolution placeholders

---

## Phase 4: Implementation Roadmap

### Quick Wins (0-2 Weeks)

1. **Compress existing images** – Convert all `public/*.png` to WebP format, reduce from ~100MB to ~20MB
2. **Add industry thumbnails** – Source 7 stock images (one per industry) for landing page cards
3. **Optimize hero images** – Ensure before/after PNGs are web-optimized

### Medium-Term (1-2 Months)

1. **Commission photography shoot** – Power station and/or dosing equipment
2. **Add case study imagery** – Kriel case study needs supporting visuals
3. **Create data visualization** – TR/TTD improvement charts, efficiency graphs

### Long-Term (3-6 Months)

1. **3D render development** – Cooling system cutaway, process animation
2. **Video content** – Brief explainer video, testimonial interviews
3. **Complete industry photography** – One custom shoot per major industry vertical

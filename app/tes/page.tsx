      <h1>Thermal Efficiency Solution (TES)</h1>
      <p>
        TES is the integration of <strong>Chemistry, IoT, Data</strong> and <strong>Verification</strong> to increase thermal efficiency, reduce energy usage and unlock carbon credits.
      </p>
      <h2>Chemistry: Dropwise vs Filmwise Condensation</h2>
      <p>
        Traditional condensers operate in a filmwise regime, where a continuous layer of water insulates the metal surface. TES uses surfactant chemistry to induce dropwise condensation, dramatically improving heat transfer and reducing fouling.
      </p>
      <h2>IoT &amp; Data</h2>
      <p>
        Embedded sensors collect real‑time performance data from boilers and condensers. Our cloud platform analyses this data to optimise dosage, detect anomalies and forecast maintenance.
      </p>
      <h2>Verification &amp; Carbon Credits</h2>
      <p>
        Independent verification by research institutions (e.g., WRC) ensures performance gains are real and quantifiable. The resulting efficiency improvements translate into verified carbon credits.
      </p>
      <h2>National Scale Concept</h2>
      <p>
        TES can be deployed across power stations, petrochemical plants, agriculture and more, enabling national‑scale efficiency improvements and creating a pipeline of carbon credits.
      </p>
      <h2>RT&amp;D Testing Logic</h2>
      <p>
        Continuous research, testing and development ensure that TES remains on the cutting edge of chemical and digital innovation.
